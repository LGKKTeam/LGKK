# Welcome to the LAM GIAU KHONG KHO TEAM

Here you'll find implementations of popular modules and algorithms and data structures in everyone's favorite new language Swift, with detailed explanations of how they work.

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!

Most code is compatible with **Xcode 8.2** and **Swift 3**. We'll keep this updated with the latest version of Swift.

:heart_eyes: **Suggestions and contributions are welcome!** :heart_eyes:
